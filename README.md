# poolpal-react-native
React native version of my PoolPal app

Uber-like ride-sharing application created with `react-native` and `react-native-map`.

Had to make some adjustments to the underlying components for the app to work properly.

## Installation
Clone this repo and run
```
npm install
```

## To run this application
Use
```
react-native start
```

or

```
react-native run-ios
```
If you are on Mac and want to run it on a simulator.

### Alternitavely,
you can run it either on a simulator or on your local device through Xcode. Just make sure to use the `.xcworkspace` project file instead of the `.xcodeproj` one.

**Note that I only make sure it supports iOS devices, for now. It may or may not work on Android devices.**
