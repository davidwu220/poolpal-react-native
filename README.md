# poolpal-react-native
React native version of my PoolPal app

Uber-like ride-sharing application created with `react-native` and `react-native-map`.

Had to make some adjustments to the underlying components for the application to work properly.

## Installation
Clone this repo and run

```
npm install
```

**You will need to follow the official [installation guide](https://github.com/react-community/react-native-maps/blob/master/docs/installation.md) to configure the application.**

## To run this application
Use

```
react-native start
```

or

```
react-native run-ios
```
If you are on Mac and want to run it on a simulator.

### Alternitavely,
You can run it either on a simulator or on your local device through Xcode. Just make sure to use the `.xcworkspace` project file instead of the `.xcodeproj` one.

**Note that I only make sure it supports iOS devices, for now. It may or may not work on Android devices.**
